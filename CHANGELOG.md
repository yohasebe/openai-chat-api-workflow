    - Superior instruction following and text rendering
    - Detailed editing capabilities
    - Real-world knowledge integration
  - DALL·E 2 and DALL·E 3 models removed (deprecated by OpenAI, support ends 05/12/2026)

- 4.2.0:
  - GPT-5.2 series models now supported (`gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-chat-latest`, `gpt-5.2-pro`)
  - New `xhigh` reasoning effort level for maximum quality tasks
  - **Model-specific reasoning effort constraints**:
    - `gpt-5.2-pro`: `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` (default: `medium`) - ⚠️ Very high pricing!
    - `gpt-5.2`: `none` / `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` (default: `none`)

    - `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`: `low` / `medium` / `high` (default: `medium`)
    - `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`: `low` / `medium` / `high` (default: `medium`)
  - Web UI now dynamically adjusts available reasoning effort options based on selected model
  - The new `none` setting in gpt-5.1 provides lower-latency interactions similar to non-reasoning models
  - For complex tasks like coding, use `high` reasoning effort
